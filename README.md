# Retail Sales Analysis (Excel Project)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes retail sales transaction data using Microsoft Excel to identify trends, customer behavior patterns, and category-level performance. The analysis focuses on transforming raw transactional data into meaningful business insights using pivot tables, charts, and structured analytical questions.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical data analysis skills including data preparation, aggregation, visualization, and insight generation using Excel.

## Dataset

- Source: Sample retail sales dataset

- Format: CSV (raw transactional data)

- Records: ~12,000 rows

- Fields include:

  - Transaction ID

## Analytical Questions Addressed

The analysis focuses on answering the following business questions:

1. What is the average monthly spend per customer?

2. Which customers are repeat buyers based on transaction frequency?

3. How do product categories perform in terms of popularity vs revenue contribution?

4. What is the monthly sales revenue trend?

5. What is the average transaction value across product categories?

## Tools & Techniques Used
